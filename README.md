## Facial Emotion Identification

You can find dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shawon10/ckplus) for this project

I have implemented this project in google colab so the addresses used to load dataset in the program are according to my drive.
Make sure you change addresses according to storage location of your dataset

### Steps to implement 



1. Run Face_Emotion_Detection.ipynb 
      - You can run it in Jupyter notebook or google colab 
      - Trained Model is saved after complete execution of this program. Make sure you save the model in the same folder.
2. Run video_tester.ipynb 
      - This requires camera permission. 
      - give the permission if it asks for it
